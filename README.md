# Game Sale

This webpage, made with React and libraries such as Chakra UI, Axios, react-query and react-router-dom will help you find games on sales and some jokes.

## Demo

https://react-game-sale.netlify.app

## With this project, I practiced

- **react-query:** to manage de cache.
- **react-router-dom:** to navigate between pages.
- **Custom hooks:** to fetch jokes and games on sale from the API.
- **Axios:** to make HTTP requests to the API.
- **Chakra UI:** using templates.
- **Skeletons:** using SkeletonText from Chakra UI while data is loading.

## API used

- https://api.chucknorris.io/
- https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
